# Positions

If you might be interested in joining us, please first take a look at our [group guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K10WS0Bey9AGr17bpiak-A1dhQrkv5BBsQrsrwQ-H2g/) for information about our values and my attitude toward research and mentorship. 

Please note that due to the high volume of email, I am unable to respond to every message I receive.

Postdoctoral opportunities that we are actively recruiting for will be advertised by topic on this page. Interested postdocs should inquire directly at [ccoley@mit.edu](mailto:ccoley@mit.edu) with a CV and a brief statement of your research interests and background. Please also mention what your professional goals are, and what you would hope to learn and accomplish, specifically, while working in the group. If we do not have any postings, I will keep your materials on file and may reach out if openings arise at a future date. If you have independent funding, please mention it in your email.

Graduate students should apply directly to the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering or the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (note: fee waivers are available through the Dean of Engineering) or the Department of Chemistry. We also have had students join from the Computational Science and Engineering program, the Computational and Systems Biology program, and the Department of Biological Engineering. Admissions is handled department-by-department or program-by-program, and as an individual I do not have full discretion to admit students without committee support.  I get a large number of emails every summer and fall from prospective applicants asking about open positions. _As a general rule, I plan to recruit 1-3 PhD students annually; the exact projects will vary and should reflect our mutual interests and funding._  

Undergraduate students looking for research opportunities for pay or credit are encouraged to directly reach out to graduate students and postdocs in the group whose interests match their own (e.g., lead authors of recent publications they find interesting). For MIT undergraduates, we occasionally have advertised openings on [ELx](https://elx.mit.edu/).
