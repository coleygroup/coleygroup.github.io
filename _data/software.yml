- title: "SPARROW"
  image:
  description: A workflow to simultaneously select molecules and their synthetic routes for lead optimization and design-make-test cycles. This optimization approach aims to minimize synthetic cost while selecting the molecules that are most likely to fulfill design constraints. More details about SPARROW can be found in our preprint.
